Hello! I’m Mansi Agarwal, an Applied Scientist at Amazon Robotics with a passion for developing cutting-edge AI solutions. With expertise spanning Computer Vision, 3D Vision, Deep Learning, Reinforcement Learning, and Generative AI, I thrive at the intersection of research and real-world application.

During my time at Amazon Robotics, I delivered a robust solution that’s now deployed across 300+ stations and counting, enhancing the existing system by a significant margin. This rapid industrial impact demonstrates my drive to turn innovative ideas into tangible improvements.

I completed my Master’s in Robotics at the Robotics Institute, Carnegie Mellon University, where I worked at the Robot Perceiving and Doing ([RPAD](https://r-pad.github.io)) Lab under [Prof. David Held](https://davheld.github.io). My research focused on deformable object manipulation, combining theoretical insights with practical implementation. Previously, I earned my Bachelor’s degree from Delhi Technological University and participated in the [RISS](https://riss.ri.cmu.edu) program at CMU, supported by the [SN Bose Scholarship](https://www.winstepforward.org/sn-bose-scholars/). 

My research journey has been dynamic and interdisciplinary, involving work on text analysis, computer vision, video processing, deformable object manipulation, and real-world robotics systems. This broad foundation has equipped me with the versatility to tackle complex AI challenges from multiple angles.

Outside of work, I’m a national-level swimmer, a trained Kathak dancer, and an avid reader. I bring the same dedication and discipline from these pursuits to my work in AI and robotics.
