Hello, I am a first year [Masters](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/education/academic-programs/master-of-science-robotics/) student in Robotics Institute at the School of Computer Science, Carnegie Mellon University. I am currently working at at Robot Perceiving and Doing ([RPAD](https://r-pad.github.io)) lab advised by [Prof. David Held](https://davheld.github.io) as a graduate research assistant. I am interested in Computer Vision, Reinforcement Learning and Deep Learning algorithms and currently investigating how we can teach robots to fold clothes without providing subgoals.
