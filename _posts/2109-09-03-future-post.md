Hello everyone!
I am Mansi Agarwal, a senior at Delhi Technological University pursuing Computer Engineering. This summer, I had a golden opportunity of interning at the Robotics Institute, Carnegie Mellon University funded by the SN BOSE Scholarship and Robotics Institute Summer Scholars Program.
This was not my first application and I encountered a lot of hardships while applying for different programs, as well as after getting one. Below I jot down some pointers, which I believe can benefit a student seeking a foreign research internship.
How to Apply?
